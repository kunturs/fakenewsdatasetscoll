It was later determined the child’s mother committed suicide and the child jumped through a second-story glass window to seek help.\n\nUtilizing a wide range of personal and professional skills during this traumatic and rapidly evolving incident, Officer Bronner was able to quickly attend to the child’s medical needs by requesting EMS and applying a tourniquet. This fast thinking greatly reduced the amount of blood loss to the child and in all likelihood saved his life. Officer Bronner quickly developed a rapport with the child gathering valuable information that would assist investigators and responding officers.\n\nAfter administering lifesaving medical treatment Officer Bronner quickly turned his focus to the trauma and stress the child was experiencing by reassuring the young boy everything would be OK. They spoke about shopping, toys, and a Spiderman movie; this brought a level of comfort and a smile to the face of this child in the midst of an overwhelming and tragic event.\n\nAs a direct result of Officer Bronner’s diligent patrol tactics and life-saving efforts, this child reached the hospital in time for treatment and is alive today.\n\nIt is for these reasons that the City of Blue Ash Police Department would like to award Police Officer Pete Bronner with the Meritorious Police Service Commendation for Courage on this 10th day of November, 2022.\n\nOfficer Pete Bronner was honored with a Meritorious Police Service Commendation for Courage at the November 10 City Council meeting.\n\nOriginal source can be found here."

My office is excited to bring new federal funding back home to support the Casa Bella project, and I’m grateful to Prosper West, Commissioner Rodriguez, the San Antonio Area Foundation, and Texas Capital Bank for their commitment to bringing this project to life.”\n\nThe Casa Bella program is designed to maintain affordable housing stock on San Antonio’s Westside. Through the program, neglected, abandoned, or chronically vacant residential properties are acquired, rehabilitated to modern housing standards, and sold to families who earn up to eighty percent of the Area Median Income.\n\nLast year, Congressman Castro secured $1 million in grant funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to support Casa Bella. Combined with additional funding from the Bexar County Commission, the grant will allow for the rehabilitation of an additional 20+ homes in the area. Texas Capital Bank, which provided funding for the first house under Casa Bella, has extended flexible financing to help support the program through the next 20+ homes.\n\n“Vacancy leads to vagrancy, and it robs our community of potential housing supply. By restoring these homes and putting them back into productive use, we are able to improve neighborhoods, increase affordable homeownership opportunities, and bring families back to the Westside,” said Prosper West President and CEO Ramiro Gonzales. “Building a new house is much more economical than rehabbing existing ones, but if we want our neighborhoods to maintain their character and still serve our housing needs, we have to do the work that the private market will not deliver.”\n\n“The Westside is one of San Antonio’s most revered cultural hubs, with a deep history of resilience, and a perfect place to provide families an opportunity to make ‘a home.’ We know that stable housing is what can change people’s lives and their trajectory of what is possible. On behalf of our board of directors and staff, we are delighted to provide catalytic support for this transformational work in providing affordable housing – one casa bella at a time!” said Patricia Mejia, Vice President of Community Engagement and Impact at the San Antonio Area Foundation.\n\n“Affordable housing is a growing crisis in San Antonio, and Texas Capital Bank is proud to partner with Prosper West on this project to benefit the families in this community,” said Ricky Maldonado, San Antonio Market President for Texas Capital Bank.\n\nThanks to a grant from the San Antonio Area Foundation, the John L. Santikos Fund, and interim financing from Texas Capital Bank, the property that opened today on West César E. Chávez Boulevard was purchased this past November. Built in 1960, the ranch-style 2-bedroom/1-bath house underwent a full transformation, bringing the property up-to-code, with fresh updates and energy-efficient upgrades. With a large backyard available for expansion and within walking distance of De Zavala Elementary School, this property is ideal for a starting family. Total project costs, including acquisition, totaled just over $210,000, but thanks to the Area Foundation grant, the home will be sold affordably for under $170,000.\n\nOriginal source can be found here."

The two-time Olympic athlete is among several local skiers featured in the film “Mavericks” that chronicles the history of the sport in Montana. Kelly Gorham photo.\n\n“Mavericks,” an award-winning documentary from Montana PBS about Montana’s freestyle skiing legacy, will be screened at two film festivals this winter in Bozeman and Polson.\n\nThe film will screen at the Bozeman International Film Festival scheduled for Friday, Jan. 27 and Saturday, Jan. 28. The screening will be followed by a Q&A with producers Scott Sterling and Kelly Gorham. More information, including a detailed schedule and ticket information, will be available at bozemanfilmcelebration.com/.\n\n“Mavericks” will also be screened at the Flathead Lake International Cinemafest in Polson on Friday, Feb. 24, and again on Sunday, Feb. 26. The Feb. 26 screening will be followed by a Q&A and discussion with Sterling, Gorham and Olympic gold medalist Eric Bergoust, who is featured in the documentary. “Mavericks” is nominated for the festival’s Best Montana Film and Best Documentary Feature awards.\n\nMore information, including details about the times of the screenings and ticket information, will be available at flicpolson.com.\n\nThe filmmakers call Montana freestyle skiers the mavericks of the sport, with multiple freestyle skiers from throughout the state getting their start on homemade jumps before going on to impressive careers. Freestyle skiing is a sport comprising aerials, moguls, half-pipe, slopestyle and more, with skiers often performing aerial flips and spins.\n\n“Mavericks” follows the careers of several Montana freestyle skiers, including Olympic gold medal winner Bergoust of Missoula, Bryon and Bradley Wilson of Butte, Darian Stevens of Missoula, Heather McPhie of Bozeman and Maggie Voisin of Whitefish.\n\nUsing archival footage and original cinematography, the film captures “the struggles, victories, unsurpassed work ethic and unbreakable spirit of some of the state’s most renowned athletes in a sport where mere seconds determine the outcome of a career,” according to Gorham, producer and writer. Sterling, director of production at Montana PBS, is the film’s producer, director and editor, and Aaron Pruitt, Montana PBS director and general manager, is the executive producer.\n\nOriginal source can be found here."

"There were 700 small businesses in ZIP Code 21224 which received Paycheck Protection Loans (PPP) of $25,000 or under. These 700 businesses received $10,388,248 in total since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nLoans of $25,000 were provided to Beta Brothers, LLC, Eckceed Corporation, Felici Cafe Catering, LLC, Highland Chiropractic Center, Inc., Phoenix Contracting Services, Inc., Sangwon Jung and Ships Ahoy, Inc.\n\nThe average PPP loan to ZIP Code 21224 businesses was $11,886.\n\nLoans are one of the biggest drivers of inflation, which is currently decimating the U.S. economy. With more money available to residents through the PPP, the purchasing power of that money is diminished, meaning it takes more money to buy the same amount of goods as before.\n\nEconomist Mickey D. Levy argued the PPP and many other assistance programs offered during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the inflation seen in recent months by boosting the economy beyond what it could reasonably handle.\n\nRoughly $800 billion was injected into the U.S. economy while interest rates were low, causing people to overextend themselves at the time to land in trouble in the future, he claimed.\n\nA 2022 study found that the PPP spent between $169,000 and $258,000 to protect one job. With the average salary of a small-business worker being around $58,000, the study found the program overspent by roughly 75 percent."

It found increasing the skills of a teacher through continued higher education resulted in improved student performance.\n\nA study by Andrew J. Rotherham at Bellwether Education Partners, said less than half of the U.S.’s millions of teachers receive any kind of pension.

"There were two small businesses in ZIP Code 23187 which received Paycheck Protection Loans (PPP) of $25,000 or under. These two businesses received $43,028 in total since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nThe largest loan underneath the $25,000 threshold was $24,974, given to Civil War Trails, Inc.\n\nThe average PPP loan to ZIP Code 23187 businesses was $21,514.\n\nLoans are one of the biggest drivers of inflation, which is currently decimating the U.S. economy. With more money available to residents through the PPP, the purchasing power of that money is diminished, meaning it takes more money to buy the same amount of goods as before.\n\nEconomist Mickey D. Levy argued the PPP and many other assistance programs offered during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the inflation seen in recent months by boosting the economy beyond what it could reasonably handle.\n\nRoughly $800 billion was injected into the U.S. economy while interest rates were low, causing people to overextend themselves at the time to land in trouble in the future, he claimed.\n\nA 2022 study found that the PPP spent between $169,000 and $258,000 to protect one job. With the average salary of a small-business worker being around $58,000, the study found the program overspent by roughly 75 percent."

"senorthcarolinanews--2023-10-06--Senator Ted Budd Urges Senate to Stay in Session Until All Appropriations Bills are Passed"	2023-10-06	"senorthcarolinanews"	"Senator Ted Budd Urges Senate to Stay in Session Until All Appropriations Bills are Passed"	"Washington, D.C. — In a joint effort, Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) and 12 other senators have penned a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), calling for the U.S. Senate to stay in session until all 12 fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills are debated, passed, and signed into law by President Biden.\n\nThe letter, led by Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE), emphasizes the importance of completing the appropriations work without delay. The 13 signatories include Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Barrasso (R-WY), Katie Boyd Britt (R-AL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), Rick Scott (R-FL), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), John Thune (R-SD), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).\n\n\"We urge you to modify the Senate calendar so that we remain in session Monday through Friday every week until all 12 fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills are passed in the Senate and House and signed into law by President Biden. The House of Representatives has already taken the step to forgo their October recess and the Senate must follow suit. While valuable work is done while Senators are back in their home states, it is imperative that we remain in DC until our appropriations work can be completed. That is what the American people expect and deserve of us.\"\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee successfully passed all 12 appropriations bills through Committee in June and July. However, during the following two months, the Senate failed to debate, amend, and pass the final versions before the September 30th deadline. Instead, the Senate recessed for five of the nine weeks without passing a single appropriations bill. The resulting continuing resolution extended government funding until November 17th, leaving seven weeks for the Senate to consider the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills.\n\n\"This is too important of an issue to put off. We must get back to regular order, and that means passing all 12 appropriations bills. We the undersigned request that you update the Senate calendar so that we are in session every weekday until all 12 appropriations bills are passed.\"\n\nFor more information, please read the full text of the letter."
